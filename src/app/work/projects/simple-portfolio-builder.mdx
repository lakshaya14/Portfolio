Overview

Development of an ANPR (Automatic Number Plate Recognition) Smart Gatekeeper System to automate vehicle entry and exit management using computer vision and a responsive web dashboard. The system improves security, reduces manual intervention, and enables real-time vehicle monitoring for campuses, parking areas, and gated communities.

Key Features
Automatic Number Plate Detection

Implemented real-time number plate detection and recognition using OCR techniques, enabling accurate vehicle identification from live camera feeds or captured images.

Smart Gate Control Logic

Designed intelligent access logic to automatically allow or deny vehicle entry based on recognized license plates, authorization rules, and confidence scores.

Real-Time Monitoring Dashboard

Built a responsive front-end dashboard using React.js to display live vehicle logs, entry/exit timestamps, plate numbers, and system alerts in an intuitive interface.

Confidence Scoring & Validation

Integrated a confidence scoring mechanism to validate OCR results, reducing false positives and improving system reliability in varying lighting and environmental conditions.

Edge Device Optimization

Optimized processing using Jetson Nano for efficient edge-level inference, reducing latency and dependency on cloud processing.

Technologies Used

React.js (Vite) – For building a fast, modular, and responsive front-end interface

OCR (Tesseract / OpenCV) – For number plate recognition and image processing

Jetson Nano – For edge AI processing and real-time inference

REST APIs – For communication between front end and backend services

HTML, CSS, JavaScript – For UI structure and styling

Challenges and Learnings

One major challenge was handling OCR accuracy under different lighting conditions and vehicle speeds. This was addressed by applying image preprocessing techniques and confidence-based filtering. Another key learning was optimizing AI workloads on resource-constrained edge devices like Jetson Nano while maintaining real-time performance. The project significantly strengthened skills in computer vision, frontend-backend integration, and system optimization.

Outcome

The ANPR Smart Gatekeeper system successfully automates vehicle access control, improves security, and minimizes manual monitoring. It provides a scalable and efficient solution suitable for smart campuses and parking systems, demonstrating practical application of AI, frontend development, and edge computing in real-world scenarios. here alter the content for trekspot which means travel and tourism flight booking application
